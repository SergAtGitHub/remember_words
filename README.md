# Remember Words

Remember words is a program developed to help a user to remember words from a list.

To launch this program:
- download zip file;
- unpack it to the *remember_words* folder;
- set location to the *remember_words* folder;
- launch the program by typing: `$ python3 remember_words.py`.

Program will automatically define all the files contained under the topics folder and let you choose which files you want to use if there are several of them.
You can add files to the topics folder and they will appear in the next launch of the program.

**Note:** to choose files you want to use just type their numbers separated by whitespace like this: `> 1 2 10`

During the game type words from the list and program will let you know if you put an unanswered word *(by typing symbol '+' and count of remaining words)* or *(symbol '-')* if the word has already been answered or doesn't exist.

**Note:** there are two special symbols which are handled by program:
- '?' - will show you all answered words;
- '-' - will show you all unanswered words and exit.

^ type any of this symbols to the line and press enter.
